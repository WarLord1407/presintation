                    <p>The aye-aye’s hands are large, and its fingers, especially the third, are long and slender. The species possesses five fingers on each hand and a pseudo-thumb, a distinct bony digit that does not occur in any other primate. All the fingers have pointed claws, as do the toes except for the large opposable flat-nailed great toes.</p>

                    <h2>MORE INFO</h2>
                    <p>The aye-aye's classification with the order Primates has been just as uncertain. It has been considered a highly derived member of the family Indridae, a basally diverging branch of the strepsirrhine suborder, and of indeterminate relation to all living primates.[16] In 1931, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines.</p>

                <h2>Additional</h2>
                <p>A full-grown aye-aye is typically about 60 centimetres (2 feet) long with a tail longer than its body. The species has an average head and body length of 36–43 cm (14–17 in) plus a tail of 56–61 cm (22–24 in), and weighs around 2 kilograms (4 pounds).[4]

                    Young aye-ayes typically are silver colored on their front and have a stripe down their back. However, as the aye-ayes begin to reach maturity, their bodies will be completely covered in thick fur and are typically not one solid color. On the head and back, the ends of the hair are typically tipped with white while the rest of the body will ordinarily be a yellow and/or brown color.
